## A Brief Introduction

Using administrative data in Official Statistics needs caution due
to the uncertainly surrounding the quality of the administrative
data. This manual guides you through implementing R code files to
obtain quality measures of the target administrative data. The
quality measures consist of two elements: distance metrics and
R-indicators. Please consult the user manual for more details on the
distance metrics and R-indicators.

This space is strictly reserved to walk through obtaining distance
metrics and R-indicators.
